## Install the Mobile App

Manage and configure your server from your phone with the RTMP Bridger mobile app. Go to :

-   Settings
-   Mobile App, at the top right corner
-   Generate QR Code
-   Open the generated link in your browser _(Chrome, Firefox or Edge recommended)_
-   Caress your screen _(yeah littarly)_
-   A dialog box appeared at the bottom of your screen, tap on it and the installation will begin

If no dialog appeares, look for 3 little dots to open the settings of the page, then select "Install RTMP Bridger" or "Add to HomeScreen".

As a last resort, ask Google : "How to install a PWA on _[your browser]_ ?"

Same steps as [Install the Mobile App](#install-the-mobile-app) but without installing it.
