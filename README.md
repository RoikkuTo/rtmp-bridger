RTMP Bridger acts like... well, a bridge between you and your OBS at home.

From wherever you are on the world, share your adventerures on Twitch, Youtube, Facebook or whatever plateform you want, by sending a video stream via RTMP directly to Bridger. Retrieve the images inside OBS and organize your scenes, templates and alerts. When you are ready just go live !

## Features

-   **Multi-Camera** compatible, connect at the same as much camera as your PC can handle which is probably **A LOT**
-   An abstract configuration
-   A graphical user interface accessible from your **desktop**, your **phone** and remotly on the **web**
-   An OBS remote controler to e.g. change the current scene
-   An Event system to handle 4G/5G drops by e.g. automatically switch to a BRB scene
-   A chatbot (Twitch) first to warn you and your viewers in chat of maybe a 4G/5G drop or a scene switch, and second to control and manage all that jazz via several commands while reading the chat
